# Welcome to my custom [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-lua/prometheus) steps!

## What is Prometheus?
Prometheus is an open source Lua Obfuscator that can be used to obfuscate lua code.
But, it isn't exactly 'secure', so to speak.

I've gotten steps created for it that:
* Decrypt the string encryption (Not public)
* Reverse the ConstantArray step (Not public)
* [Disable the AntiTamper](Prometheus-AntiTamper-Bypass.lua) (Closed-Source step. Will not open source, or it will be patched.)
